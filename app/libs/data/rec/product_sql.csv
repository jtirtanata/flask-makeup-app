Worn under foundation, this oil-free Primer creates a smooth, flawless canvas for application, allowing foundation to glide on easily and stay fresh and color-true for hours.

She added oil-controlling ingredients for a semi-matte, long-wear finish.

-4. To make the nose look shorter: Apply the contour shade to the very tip and underneath the tip between your nostrils to add shadows for the illusion of a shorter nose.

For cheeks:
-1. Suck in your cheeks to find the perfect hollow from your ear to the corner of your mouth.
-2. Using the contour shade, apply along this line and blend upward to create the illusion of sculpted cheeks by creating shadows.
-3. Blend upwards to instantly give the illusion of a facelift.
-4. Apply blush right above the contoured line—on the apples of your cheeks—to create a naturally flushed look.

The airy, lightweight powders contain optically transparent particles that amplify the colors to a multidimensional level, effectively reinventing the way you view blush.

Each handmade blush is formulated using an advanced miscelare technique to create the perfect balance of pigment and powder, and no two look alike. (""Miscelare"" means “to mix” in Italian.) The six shades—ranging from soft coral to cool pink—offer a wardrobe of captivating accent lights for cheeks. They deliver a radiant, natural finish and offer buildable color to imbue the entire complexion with an otherworldly glow.

-Apply just as you would a pressed powder. Avoid the eye area.
-For medium to full coverage, dampen the sponge, then smooth powder onto face.
-For best results, use after your preferred Laura Mercier Foundation Primer.

Pro tips:
-For the most flawless, natural look, Laura Mercier says it's key to avoid over-applying foundation to the middle of the face—where too much formula can accentuate lines and other imperfections.
-Whether it’s liquid, cream, or powder, Laura recommends starting at the outer portion of the face and working inward towards the nose.
-Focus on one area at a time and be sure to blend well, especially below the jaw line.
-Avoid excess application around eyes or the contours of the face. Repeat application until desired coverage is achieved."

""I have some very fond memories of watching my mother do her makeup before she’d go out on a date. I could sit there for hours and watch her as she would choose her clothes and put her makeup on. She’d take a piece of black velvet ribbon and she would scrape it with a knife so she could take the pile from the black velvet to make the lashes even thicker and clumpier.""—Marc Jacobs

To Prep lips to improve consistency and length of wear:
-Gently exfoliate with lip scrub or a hot bath towel and hydrate your lips.
-Wipe off any excess of oil.
-Create evenness by covering your lips with foundation or concealer, especially if you want to correct them.

To define your lips:
-Start with the center of your lip, defining your cupid's bow with an X shape and lining the center-bottom of your lips. You want to make both lips look balanced.

To upgrade your lip size with two shades:
-Apply the light Lip Contour outside your natural lip line and fill in your lips with the same shade.
-Don’t go too bold on the outline to keep it natural.
-Apply the dark Lip Contour following the exact same outlined shape.
-Insist on the inner corners of the mouth to create depth and draw a vertical line in the center of your lips to add some 3D effect.
-Blend the two shades pressing a tissue on your lips or using a hint of lip balm.

For the perfect lip enhancer combos:
-Use Trendsetter (Contour) with Bombshell (Highlight)
-Use Vixen (Contour) with Famous (Highlight)
-Use Famous (Contour) with Trophy Wife (Highlight)

To correct uneven shape:
-Use the same technique as above but contour outside your natural lip line on the thinner section while simply following it on the fuller part.

To downplay fuller lips:
-Cover your lips with foundation or concealer and draw your lip shape just inside the natural outline.

Precautions:
-Store in a cool and dry atmosphere."

BROWVO! Conditioning Primer:
-For first time use, twist the base continuously until gel appears on the tip.
-For daily use, click the pen once and wait for the gel to appear. Glide the custom applicator through brows to evenly coat from root to tip.
-Allow the conditioning primer to dry completely before applying brow makeup.
-Tip: apply BROWVO! Conditioning Primer Nutrient Rich Eyebrow Primer to brows before bed so that it can work while you sleep.

The POREfessional Face Primer:
-To prime in the morning, apply a thin layer to moisturized skin from the center of the face outward.
-Wait a few seconds and apply makeup as usual or wear alone.


Gimme Brow Volumizing Fiber Gel:
-Using short pressing motions, stroke the precision tip along the brow to define and shape.
-Brush through with the custom tiny tapered brush to blend and build.
-Stroke on more to build thicker-looking brows. To get the most natural look, start at the inner edge of your brow and move outward.
-For the fullest, thickest-looking results, gently glide the brush against the direction of your hair growth starting at the tail, and allow the color to settle. Then brush hairs back into place.

Goof Proof Brow Pencil Easy Shape & Fill:
-Use the wide part of the custom tip to shape and fill brows using a couple of strokes from the start to your arch to build color.
-Use the pointed edge of the tip to define the outer end (the tail) of your brows.
-Blend with spoolie brush for full and natural-looking brows.

Ka-BROW! Cream-Gel Eyebrow Color with Brush:
-Remove the brush from the cap. For better handling, flip the brush around and snap the base back in so that the mini brush becomes full-size.
-Lightly glide the brush across the cream-gel color. A little goes a long way, so don’t be shy about dabbing any excess off.
-For a natural look, stroke a tiny amount of color onto brows and blend in using short strokes. Layer on more for added drama.
-For extra definition and shape, first outline the shape of your brow with the angled edge of the brush, and then fill in the rest using tiny strokes.
-Wipe the brush clean and snap it back into the cap, bristle-side down. Close the cap tightly to keep the color from drying out.

Pro tips:
-For the most flawless, natural look, Laura says it's key to avoid over-applying foundation to the middle of the face—where too much formula can accentuate lines and other imperfections.
-Whether it’s liquid, cream, or powder, she recommends starting at the outer portion of the face and working inward towards the nose.
-Focus on one area at a time and be sure to blend well, especially below the jaw line.
-Avoid excess application around eyes or the contours of the face.
-Repeat application until desired coverage is achieved."

How to touch up:

Customize your color by layering and blending as much as you desire to tailor your look for the occasion or the season. Air Blush delivers 24-hour blush wear, for glowing radiance from day to night.

The three contour shades create realistic shadows to recede facial features, while the three highlight shades impart a soft luminosity to amplify dimension, so you can effortlessly sculpt, chisel, shape, and slenderize your features for enhanced definition.

“I learned early on how different types of light can truly flatter the complexion. Growing up, my mother had pink light bulbs in all of the lamps throughout the house. She loved pink light because it was the softest and most flattering, and she always wanted to look good. I used this concept of lighting in Ambient Lighting Powder.”—Carisa Janes, Hourglass Founder

Ambient® Lighting Powder comes in six shades:
Ethereal Light: An opalescent sheer, cool white powder that mimics a moonlit glow, even in broad daylight.
Diffused Light: A soft, warm, pale yellow powder that conceals redness and gives skin clarity like a soft ray of morning light.
Dim Light: A neutral peach beige powder that blurs imperfections and highlights a radiant complexion with the perfect balance of warm and cool tones.

Naked Skin Highlighting Fluid lets you achieve ""non-touring"", a technique that lets you achieve gorgeous, glowing skin that never looks overdone. This creamy highlighter’s sheer, weightless formula is easy to use and blends beautifully, giving skin a dewy, lit-from-within look.

Naked Skin Highlighting Fluid is strobing the Urban Decay Naked way. The formula absorbs into the skin rather than sitting on top, so your skin still shows through. Get that it’s-you-only-better look with a range of shades—from cult favorites like Sin (the perfect champagne) and Fireball (peach with a pink shift) to Skywalk (a blue hue). Urban Decay’s founder, Wende Zomnir loves layering powder highlighter on top of Naked Skin Highlighting Fluid for added depth and dimension.

Great for every complexion type, including dry or mature skin, Naked Skin Highlighting Fluid is really wearable—even if you’re not normally the highlighter type. Subtle pearlescent pigments diffuse light to perfect skin, while antioxidant-rich vitamin C and vitamin E condition and protect. Based off of Naked Skin Concealer, it’s weightless, and it can be applied anywhere you want to create a glowy, strobed effect—including the cheekbones, the bridge of the nose, and the Cupid’s bow.",http://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s1902279-main-Lhero.jpg,"Aura

For the first time ever, Glow Stick Glistening Illuminator imparts a universal glow that flatters all skin tones. The sheer cream luminizer gives skin an unparalleled, mist-like radiance that results from the balanced ratio of pearly gold and silver pigments—allowing both warm and cool complexions to beam with covetable, youthful light. Unlike powder luminizers and highlighters, this fresh-looking cream fuses with the complexion for a healthy-looking sheen. To make it even creamier and more touchable than any other cream luminizer, it undergoes a unique process in the lab for its irresistible, silky-soft feeling that never feels wet or sticky. The oval shape of the stick applicator is designed for impeccable one-swipe coverage, fitting perfectly at the tops of cheekbones. The palm-shaped case and roll-up dial are travel-ready, so that you can say goodbye to cracked powder compacts. Glow Stick glides on smoothly and effortlessly for the right dose of dewiness anytime, anywhere. Consider it your portable spotlight.

Solutions for:

If you want to know more…
As an antiaging expert, Dr. Kaplan understands that both men and women want fuller, more youthful lips without surgery. He created Perfect Pout as a natural alternative to visibly plump lips and smooth fine lines, while hydrating and protection against sun damage. LIP 20 Mask contains papaya enzymes, two forms of hyaluronic acid, and adipofill’in, a patented amino acid that naturally plumps the lip contour. It gently exfoliates away dry skin for lips that are instantly softer, smoother, and more defined. LIP 20 Balm is an ultra-hydrating formula that moisturizes, nourishes, and protects with SPF 20. Using a soothing blend of beeswax and sunflower seed wax, it gently glides onto the lips, while nourishing the skin with 22 organic extracts. It also contains a powerful lip plumping peptide, maxi-lip, along with hyaluronic filling spheres, to give lips added hydration and natural fullness.

This set contains:

Tips: if you tend to get dry lips while you sleep, use this Lip Mask + Lip Balm Duo as a nighttime lip treatment. Simply spread a very light layer of LIP 20 Mask directly onto lips. Then, pat on a thin layer of LIP 20 Balm. Allow both products to stay on your lips while you sleep, and wake up to beautifully soft, hydrated lips. To treat the fine lines and wrinkles around the lips, and on the skin above the lips that cause lipstick to bleed, apply the LIP 20 Mask at least a half-inch beyond the lip line to treat the area.

A full-coverage, matte-finish, waterproof foundation that lasts all night.

What it does:
All Nighter Liquid Foundation by Urban Decay provides full coverage with a modern matte finish that never looks overdone. Get all-night wear and a blown-out effect you never thought was possible for a flawless-looking complexion that looks amazing and stays that way. Perfect for all-night affairs, this innovative formula is also comfortable enough to wear every day.

While Naked Skin complexion products are semi-matte, All Nighter Liquid Foundation is completely matte and oil-free. Urban Decay loaded this formula with an higher amount of pigment (about three times as much as Naked Skin Liquid Makeup), so a little goes a long way. There’s no need to build coverage or apply multiple layers. This waterproof formula diffuses light to blur flaws for beautifully perfected skin, while it mattifies and absorbs oil to reduce the appearance of shine.

With a wide range of carefully calibrated shades that match Urban Decay’s existing Naked Skin Liquid Makeup shades, it’s easy to find your perfect match. Because All Nighter Liquid Foundation is so high coverage, it's important to choose the right shade. Just swatch the product on the skin, blend down, and allow to set to see if it's the right match for you.

What else you need to know:
All Nighter Liquid Foundation comes in a sleek, edgy bottle that has a luxurious, highly metallized, gunmetal effect with asymmetric cutouts.

A tube-forming, water-resistant mascara that gives buildable, glamorous volume with no smudging, flaking, running, or clumping.

What it does:
After almost a decade in development, Blinc Mascara Amplified provides incredible, buildable volume and length, all while offering their signature LifeProof properties of the original Blinc Mascara—smudge-proof, sweat-proof, water-resistant, and flake-proof. As with the original, Mascara Amplified coats lashes with a glossy, volumizing and extending coat that forms tiny water-resistant “tubes” around the lash. But, unlike the first formula, this one applies more like a traditional mascara, giving you the ability to add as many coats as you want to build your desired look! Because it is not as wet of a formula, you can even go back and reapply if needed, after it dries.

What else you need to know:
Removing Blinc Mascara Amplified is just as easy, and requires no makeup remover. Simply apply a little warm water along with some gentle pressure, and the tubes easily slide off your lashes. You will actually see the tiny tubes in your hand as it comes off without leaving any messy black tint or residue behind.",http://www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s1495183-main-Lhero.jpg,"Black
